The Repository Pattern is an abstraction of the Data Access Layer.
It ensures the details of exactly how the data is saved or retrieved is hidden.
The details of how the data is stored and retrieved is in the respective repository. 
It can be seen that up until "Implement Repository Pattern - Part 1" in section 6, the Controller is 
involved heavily in the decision making. 
The controller should be receiving requests, route the request, then return data. It shouldn't 
necessarily contain how data was retrieved or whatever formatting is applied. 

This is analogous to a manager in a work place. The manager assigns tasks and expects results. They 
are not cornced of details regarding the actual completion of the task.
