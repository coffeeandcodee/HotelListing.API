Rest is a shorthand for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.
A Web API (or Web Service) that conforms to the REST Architectural style
is a REST API.

Concepts

UNIFORM
REST API generally has a UNIFORM INTERFACE. The URL and request appear uniform. Easy for a client to connect to an API and carry out various activities without needing too much alteration between procedures

STATELESS
Server cannot use any previously stored context information on the server

CACHEABLE
If the response is cacheable, the client app gets the right to reuse
the response data later when making identical requests and specified method.

LAYERED
REST APIS help facilitate layered systems.


RESOURCES
A resource is anything that can be retrieved or interacted with by the API.
Any data, metadata, hyper media file, etc.
The client doesn't need to be exposed to what kind of resources the API is 
interacting with, which the need for self description.

SELF-DESCRIPTIVE
