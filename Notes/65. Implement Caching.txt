Response caching specifies creating a temporary store in between specifically get requests.
.NET has caching built in and we can configure middleware that prrovides this kind of operation.

Response caching can be made at the software level. This will put load on the server. 

Bear in mind to avoid overwhelming machine with the cache storage.
